# FormSlices

A form slice connects a [morph](../morphs) with a [wordform](https://github.com/cldf/cldf/tree/master/components/forms).
The position of a morph in the form is specified with an `Index` column, delimiters like `-` in the `Form` column of the `FormTable` taking on the function of delimiting morphs.
**This is not a great solution**, but it works.
